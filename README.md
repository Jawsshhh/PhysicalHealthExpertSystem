## Track and Field Expert System Chatbot (Prolog)

This project is a rule-based expert system chatbot implemented in Prolog that recommends appropriate track-and-field sports for users based on their physical attributes, athletic capabilities, and health condition. The system simulates the decision-making process of a professional coach by encoding expert knowledge into a structured ruleset.

Developed as part of the course Introduction to Intelligent Systems (CSINTSY) at De La Salle University – Laguna.
